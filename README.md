<strong>Car Soccer</strong><br/>
It is a Unity-based game where players can play soccer by driving cars.<br/>
All game mechanics and assets are created by the author and are permitted for use in your own projects free of charge.<br/>
The game currently includes a single-player mode with AI-controlled cars, offering various match setups such as 1v1, 2v2 (with an AI teammate), or uneven matches like 2v1 and 1v2.<br/>
The creation of the game is documented in a YouTube video series, where the author demonstrates almost the entire process of building the game from scratch.<br/>
Through the video series, viewers can see the development of game models, textures, scripts, and the integration of sound and music, as well as the implementation of single-player capabilities.<br/>
I am planning to create a multiplayer mode in the future.<br/>
For now, have fun playing against AI players.<br/>

<strong>Acknowledgments</strong>
I used techniques demonstrated in videos from the 'Ryan King Art' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RyanKingArt">YouTube channel</a> to create textures for the game.<br/>
For the cars AI, I used Habrador's implementation of the Dubins Paths algorithm, which is available on his <a href="https://github.com/Habrador/Self-driving-vehicle/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/Pathfinding/Fixed%20paths/DubinsPaths">GitHub</a>.<br/>
I would like to express my sincere thanks to them.

Thank you for your interest in this project!<br/>
Follow along with the video series to see the game develop from a simple idea to a playable game.<br/>
